SVG files in /svg generated with https://github.com/ObviousInRetrospect/GenPinoutSVG from the csv files in pincsv

## /cfg
These are hand edited override configuration files to define pinout variations and other settings.

## /json
These are generated from the atpack data published by Microchip as modified by the definitions in /cfg. I might eventually clean up and publish the tool that does this extraction.

## /pincsv
These are generated from the inputs in /json. I might eventually clean up and publish the tool that does this generation.
